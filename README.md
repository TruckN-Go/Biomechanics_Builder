Temporal Analysis of Athletic Performance & Injury Risk. Here, I've created mock data of atheltes initiating sprint accelerations, jump shots, and pitches. With this data, I designed data visualizations with an X-AXIS (time) that depicts a silhouette of the corresponding action to the plotted data. The opaque, solid line indicates the temporal mean across athetes, and the transparent regions are the +/- the temporal standard deviation between athletes. The scripts change the color masking the graphs and X-AXIS silhouettes when the "graph_color" variable get assigned a different hex code. I hand drew these silhouettes to design figure panels that told a story.
