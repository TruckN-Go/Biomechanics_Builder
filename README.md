## Sport Biomechanics

Temporal Analysis of Athletic Performance & Injury Risk. Here, I've created mock data of atheltes initiating sprint accelerations, jump shots, and pitches. With this data, I designed data visualizations with an X-AXIS (time) that depicts a silhouette of the corresponding action to the plotted data. The opaque, solid line indicates the temporal mean across athetes, and the transparent regions are the +/- the temporal standard deviation between athletes. `change_figure_panel_colors()` changes the color masking the graphs and X-AXIS silhouettes.
